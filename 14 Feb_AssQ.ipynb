    "Multithreading is a programming concept that involves dividing a single process into multiple smaller and independent tasks, known as threads, that can be executed concurrently. \n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is used to improve the performance of a program by allowing it to execute multiple tasks simultaneously. For example, if a program needs to perform several I/O-bound tasks, such as downloading data from the internet or reading files from disk, using multithreading can help to avoid blocking the main thread and improve the overall speed of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **threading** module is used to handle threads. This module provides a way to create and manage threads in a high-level, object-oriented manner. The **threading** module defines a **Thread** class, which is used to create and manage individual threads of execution."

    "**Q5.** State advantages and disadvantages of multithreading.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Increased performance: Multithreading allows the program to execute multiple tasks concurrently, which can lead to a significant increase in performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Improved responsiveness: Multithreading can make the program more responsive, as it allows the user interface to remain active while other tasks are being executed in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Better resource utilization: Multithreading can make more efficient use of system resources, such as CPU time and memory, by allowing multiple tasks to share these resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Simplified coding: Multithreading can simplify the coding of complex tasks, as it allows the code to be broken down into smaller, more manageable parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Increased complexity: Multithreading can make the code more complex and harder to debug, as it introduces new issues such as race conditions and deadlocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Synchronization issues: Multithreading requires synchronization between threads to ensure that they do not interfere with each other. This can add overhead and make the code more difficult to manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Resource contention: Multithreading can lead to resource contention, where multiple threads are competing for the same resources, such as CPU time or memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Reduced predictability: Multithreading can make the program's behavior less predictable, as the order in which tasks are executed can vary depending on the system load and other factors."

    "**Q6.** Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked, waiting for each other to release resources that they are holding. This can happen when a thread acquires one resource, but then cannot proceed until it acquires another resource that is being held by a different thread. Meanwhile, that other thread is also waiting for the first thread to release a resource that it is holding. This can result in a situation where both threads are stuck, waiting for the other to release a resource, and the program becomes unresponsive.\n",
    "\n",
    "A race condition occurs when the behavior of a program depends on the order in which two or more threads execute their instructions. This can happen when two threads access the same shared resource, such as a variable or a file, and their access is not synchronized properly. Depending on the order in which the threads access the resource, the program may produce different results, or even crash. This can be particularly problematic when one thread modifies the shared resource while another thread is using it, leading to inconsistent or unexpected behavior."
