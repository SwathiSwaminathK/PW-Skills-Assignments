    "**Q1.** What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:**\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database that stores data in a JSON-like format. It is designed to scale horizontally and provides flexible and dynamic schemas that allow for easy data modeling and retrieval. MongoDB is open source and is used by many organizations for its ease of use, scalability, and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional relational database model. Instead of storing data in tables with predefined columns and rows, NoSQL databases store data in a more flexible format, such as documents, key-value pairs, or graph structures. This makes it easier to store and query unstructured or semi-structured data, and allows for more efficient scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where flexibility, scalability, and performance are the key requirements. Some of the specific use cases where MongoDB is commonly used are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Web applications: MongoDB is popular for web applications because of its ability to handle large volumes of unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Big data: MongoDB is often used in big data environments where data is constantly changing and needs to be processed in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mobile and social media apps: MongoDB is also commonly used for mobile and social media applications, where fast read and write operations are important.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Content management: MongoDB is well-suited for content management applications where the structure of the data may change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Real-time analytics: MongoDB's flexible data model and fast querying capabilities make it ideal for real-time analytics."

    "**Q2.** State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:**\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database that provides a variety of features that make it well-suited for handling large volumes of unstructured data. Some of the key features of MongoDB are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dynamic schema: MongoDB's dynamic schema allows for flexible data modeling, making it easy to store and retrieve data of different types and structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Document-oriented: MongoDB is a document-oriented database, meaning it stores data in documents in a JSON-like format. This makes it easy to work with data that is unstructured or semi-structured.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. High performance: MongoDB provides high performance for both read and write operations due to its ability to horizontally scale and use memory efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally, allowing it to handle large volumes of data and high traffic loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Rich query language: MongoDB provides a rich query language that supports a wide variety of queries, including range queries, regular expressions, and geospatial queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Indexing: MongoDB provides indexing capabilities that allow for efficient searching and querying of large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Aggregation framework: MongoDB's aggregation framework allows for complex data analysis and manipulation, making it well-suited for real-time analytics and business intelligence applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. High availability and fault tolerance: MongoDB provides high availability and fault tolerance through automatic failover and replication, ensuring that data is always available even in the event of hardware failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Security: MongoDB provides several security features such as authentication, authorization, encryption, and auditing to ensure that data is secure."
