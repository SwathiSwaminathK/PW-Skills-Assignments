    "\n",
    "**Ans:**\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols. API stands for Application Programming Interface. In the context of APIs, the word Application refers to any software with a distinct function. Interface can be thought of as a contract of service between two applications. This contract defines how the two communicate with each other using requests and responses. API architecture is usually explained in terms of client and server. The application sending the request is called the client, and the application sending the response is called the server. \n",

    "**Ans:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Increased Visibility and Traffic\n",
    " First, it allows you to share your data and functionality with a broader audience, increasing traffic and visibility for your website or app.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Seamless Integration\n",
    " It makes it easy to integrate with other applications and services, saving you time and money.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Increased Efficiency\n",
    " It allows you to access data and functionality without navigating multiple menus or screens. This can speed up the   development process and make your app or website more user-friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Easier Maintenance\n",
    " It reduces the amount of work needed on the back-end, making maintenance and updates more effortless and less time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Reduced Costs\n",
    " It allows developers to reuse code and functionality in multiple applications, saving time and money.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Improved Customer Experience\n",
    " It makes it easier for users to access your data and functionality across multiple devices or platforms, improving the user experience and increasing customer satisfaction.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Increased Complexity\n",
    " First, they can be complex and challenging to use, making them challenging for novice developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Limited Functionality\n",
    " They may not have all the functionality you need, requiring additional development work.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dependency on Third Party Services\n",
    " If it depends on a third-party service, your application will also be unavailable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Security and Privacy Risks\n",
    " They can pose security and privacy risks if they’re not implemented correctly. Therefore, it’s essential to carefully consider these risks before using them in your application."

    "A web API is an application programming interface for either a web server or a web browser. It is a web development concept, usually limited to a web application's client-side (including any web frameworks being used), and thus usually does not include web server or browser implementation details such as SAPIs or APIs unless publicly accessible by a remote web application.\n",

    "**Q4.** Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### <u>REST Architecture</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "REST works on top of the HTTP transport. It takes advantage of HTTP’s native capabilities, such as GET, PUT, POST and DELETE. When a request is sent to a RESTful API, the response (the “representation” of the information “resource” being sought) returns in either the JSON, XML or HTML format. A RESTful API is defined by a web address, or Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), which typically follows a naming convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to SOAP, REST is easier to work with and more flexible:\n",
    "\n",
    "* No expensive tools needed in order for interaction with web services.\n",
    "* Shorter learning curve.\n",
    "* More efficient (XML, used in SOAP messages, is longer than REST’s message formats).\n",
    "* Faster, with less processing required.\n",
    "\n",
    "REST API architecture have constraints: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Uniform Interface:**\n",
    "\n",
    " The fundamental design to any RESTful system, which differentiates between a REST API and non-REST API. This constraint simplifies the architecture by providing a uniform way of interacting with a given server (irrespective of device or application type).\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Client Server:**\n",
    "\n",
    " This constraint essentially says that servers and clients should only know resource URLs, and that's all. There are no dependencies. Any can be developed and replaced independently so long as interface between them is unaltered. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Statelessness:**\n",
    "\n",
    " This constraint, by definition, means all client-server interactions are stateless. Every request is treated as new, with no sessions nor history. If the end-user requires a stateful application, then each request from the client then must contain all necessary information to service the request.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cacheability:**\n",
    "\n",
    " Caching in REST should be applied to resources when applicable. This can be implemented on both the server or client side.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "* **Layered System:**\n",
    "\n",
    " REST enables using a layered system architecture, where perhaps the APIs are deployed on one server, data is stored on another, and requests are authenticated on yet another. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Code on Demand:**\n",
    "\n",
    " This optional constraint means that you are able to, upon need, provide executable code to the client.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " ### <u>SOAP Architecture</u>\n",
    " \n",
    "The SOAP web services architecture is based on interactions between three components: a service provider, a service requester, and an optional service registry.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The service provider\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The collection of software that provides a web service.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - The application program\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - The middleware\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - The platform on which they run\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* The service requester\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The collection of software that is responsible for requesting a web service from a service provider.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - The application program\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - The middleware\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - The platform on which they run\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "* The service registry\n",
    "\n",
    "  The service registry is a central location where service providers can publish their service descriptions and where service requesters can find those service descriptions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The registry is an optional component of the web services architecture because service requesters and providers can communicate without it in many situations. For example, the organization that provides a service can distribute the service description directly to the users of the service in a number of ways, including offering the service as a download from an FTP site.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Using a service registry offers a number of advantages to both the requester and provider; for example, using the IBM WebSphere Service Registry and Repository (WSRR) can help the requester to find services more quickly and can help the provider to enforce version control of the services being offered.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "*Shortcomings of SOAP API*\n",
    "\n",
    "* SOAP only uses XML. It doesn't take other formats like JSON into consideration.\n",
    "* There is a high possibility of coupling between client and server as SOAP is based on contract.\n",
    "* Since it uses XML format, SOAP is considered to be a slow platform because the payload is large for a simple string message.\n",
    "* Any change in server contract is reflected in client stub classes.\n",
    "* SOAP is hard to test in browsers.\n",
    "* SOAP clients do not hold any stateful references to remote objects."
