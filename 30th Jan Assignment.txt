1.	Write a program to accept percentage from the user and display the grade according to the following criteria:
 
Ans: 
percent = int(input("Enter the % of marks obtained: "))
if percent >90:
    print('Your Grade is A')
elif percent > 80 and percent <=90:
    print('Your Grade is B')
elif percent >=60 and percent <=80:
    print('Your Grade is C')
else:
    print('Your Grade is D')


2.	Write a program to accept the cost price of a bike and display the road tax to be paid according to the following criteria:
 
Ans: 
cost = int(input("Enter the cost price of bike: "))
if cost >100000:
    print('Tax is 15%')
    print('Your Road Tax amount is: ',cost*(15/100))
elif cost >50000 and cost <=100000:
    print('Tax is 10%')
    print('Your Road Tax amount is: ',cost*(10/100))
else:
    print('Tax is 5%')
    print('Your Road Tax amount is: ',cost*(5/100))

3.	Accept any city from the user and display monuments of that city.
 
Ans: 
print("List of City \n 1. Delhi \n 2. Agra \n 3. Jaipur \n")
city = input("Enter a city from List: ")
if city =='Delhi' or city =='delhi':
    print('Monument of the city: Red Fort')
elif city =='Agra' or city =='agra':
    print('Monument of the city: Taj Mahal')
elif city =='Jaipur' or city =='jaipur':
    print('Monument of the city: Jal Mahal')
else:
    print("Invalid Input!!!")

4.	Check how many times a given number can be divided by 3 before it is less than or equal to 10.
Ans: 
num = int(input("Enter a num to check the no of divisibility by 3: "))
temp = num
count = 0
while temp >10:
    if temp % 3 == 0:
        temp = temp/3
        count = count + 1
    else:
        break
print("Count of", num, "divided by 3:", count)

5.	Why and when to use while loop in python give a detailed description with example.
Ans: 
A while Loop is used to repeat a specific block of code to unknown number of times, until the give condition is satisfied.
Example: 
num = int(input("Enter a num to check the no of divisibility by 3: "))
temp = num
count = 0
while temp >10:
    if temp % 3 == 0:
        temp = temp/3
        count = count + 1
    else:
        break
print("Count of", num, "divided by 3:", count)

6.	Use nested while loop to print 3 different patterns.
Ans: 
(A)
row = 5   
i = 1
while i <= row :
    j = 1
    while j <= i:
        print("*", end=" ")
        j = j + 1
    print()
    i = i + 1

(B)
row = 5   
i = 1
while i <= row:
    j = row
    while j >= i:
        print("*", end=" ")
        j = j - 1
    print()    
    i = i + 1  

(C)
row = 5   
i = 1
temp = round(row/2)
while i <= temp :
    j = 1
    while j <= i:
        print("*", end=" ")
        j = j + 1
    print()
    i = i + 1
while i <= row:
    j = row
    while j >= i:
        print("*", end=" ")
        j = j - 1
    print()    
    i = i + 1  

7.	Reverse a while loop to display numbers from 10 to 1.
Ans: 
i = 10
while i>=1:
    print(i)
    i = i-1

8.	Reverse a while loop to display numbers from 10 to 1.
Ans: 
i = 10
while i>=1:
    print(i)
    i = i-1
