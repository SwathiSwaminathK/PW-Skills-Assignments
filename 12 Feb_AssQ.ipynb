    "**Q1.** What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exception and Syntax errors.\n",

    "**Ans:**\n",
    "\n",
    "An Exception in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. Exceptions are typically raised when a runtime error occurs, such as when a program tries to divide by zero, access a non-existent list index, or open a file that doesn't exist. Python provides a number of built-in exceptions that can be raised, such as ZeroDivisionError, IndexError, and FileNotFoundError. \n",
    "\n",
    "In case of Syntax error, occurs when the code violates the rules of the programming language's syntax. This is usually due to a typo, a missing parenthesis, or a similar mistake. "
